dict.eight.wizzard
==================

Transcription checking, downloading and notification wizzard.

Optimised for a particular website, this will automatically notify the user at desired intervals of new available tasks.
It will present them in size order (useful because the longer files have a higher mean value - lines/Â£ per MB).
Notifications include audio, visual and skype call / chat (implemented but not pushed to github yet).
Login to https using mechanize, auto-login and refresh periods are specified in the config.

All options are previously encrypted with dict/encodeOptions.py - see --help for details.

See dict/wizzard.py --help for full options.
